# PresentationBingoCards
Bingo cards for meetings :)


## What it does: 

Every time in a meeting that a participant hears a phrase (like “ Hi, can you hear me?” or “ can everyone see my screen?” or others …)  he can check one of the cards. In the final you can see for the meeting how many cards you have checked.
